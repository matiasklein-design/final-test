The 28-year-old scrum-half suffered a serious knee injury on March 8 and will be sidelined for games against Rugby World Cup winners South Africa, Fiji and Australia.</p>

			<p>"We'll be eight months on from my injury," the Toulouse half-back told French newspaper L'Equipe. "I think it's a reasonable amount of time. I hope everything will go well between now and then. I'm not sure it would be very intelligent to rush, even if it's hard to miss international games."</p></td>
