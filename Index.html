				Rugby is a game in which the objective is to move the ball over the opponent's goal line and bring it to the ground to score points.</p>

				<p>The above description may sound simple, but there's a catch. To advance, the ball must be passed backward. The ball can be kicked forward, but to intervene, the kicker's teammates must be behind the ball at the moment it is kicked.</p>

				<p>This apparent contradiction creates the need for good teamwork and great discipline, as very little can be achieved by playing individually. Only by working as a team can players advance the ball toward the opponent's goal line and eventually score points to win the match.</p>

				<p>Rugby has its own unique aspects, but like other sports, it is essentially concerned with the creation and utilization of space. The winner of a rugby match will be the team of players who can occupy the spaces and use them intelligently, while denying the opposing team both possession of the ball and access to the space in which to use it.</p>
